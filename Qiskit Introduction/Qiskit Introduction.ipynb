    "\n",
    "This notebook is a brief and tiny introduction to the IBM Qiskit package. The IBM Qiskit framework offers a huge variety of very interesting functionalities to explore. Please refer to the [IBM Quantum Documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Qiskit is not the only quantum programming environment. There are several other options for you to explore, for instance: [Quantum Inspire](https://www.quantum-inspire.com/), [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq), [Q#](https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/concepts/qsharp), etc.. Moreover there are multiple software frameworks that offer extensions for quantum computing, for instance: [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/), [Yao](https://yaoquantum.org/), [OpenFermion](https://quantumai.google/openfermion), etc.\n",
    "\n",

We start by creating a very simple [QuantumCircuit](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#quantumcircuit) with 1 qubit and 1 output. Hence, we need a [QuantumRegister](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumRegister#quantumregister). Additionally, we are going to measure such qubit; therefore we will also need a [ClassicalRegister](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.ClassicalRegister#classicalregister).\n",

    "After creating the circuit, we will add the gates to be applied. In this example, that will be the [X gate](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#x).
