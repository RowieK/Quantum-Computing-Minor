    "## Introduction to Qiskit\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a extension to the brief introduction to the IBM Qiskit package covered in the Quantum Programming 1 lesson. The IBM Qiskit framework offers a huge variety of very interesting functionalities to explore. This workshop will require you to investigate about the proper usage of the tool. Please refer to the [IBM Quantum Documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/).\n",
    "\n",
    "As expected, this workshop is aimed to be a starting point for you in the Qiskit environment. During the minor, we will cover some additional features of the framework and you will have the opportunity of implementing and testing your own quantum circuits, allowing you to improve and increase your knowledge of Qiskit and Quantum Computing in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Qiskit is not the only quantum programming environment. There are several other options for you to explore, for instance: [Quantum Inspire](https://www.quantum-inspire.com/), [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq), [Q#](https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/concepts/qsharp), etc.. Moreover there are multiple software frameworks that offer extensions for quantum computing, for instance: [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/), [Yao](https://yaoquantum.org/), [OpenFermion](https://quantumai.google/openfermion), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of this workshop is that you will implement, simulate and analyze some of the features of the Qiskit package, by means of a set of exercises.\n",

    "## Exercise 1: A bit more complicated circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "During the lesson: A One Qubit World, we presented various quantum gates such as the Pauli gates: [X gate](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#x), [Y gate](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#y) and [Z gate](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#z), the [Hadamard gate](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#h), and the [Phase gate](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#s). Single-qubit quantum gates are an important part of Qiskit, hence we will start using them into a more complex circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may understand, the goal of this workshop is not to present every single gate that you could use in your circuits. However, as you would see, there is a big similarity in the way of using the different quantum gates within a quantum circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercise you will implement a simple quantum circuit, will perform the simulation, present the results and plot the intermediate quantum states. The circuit is the following:\n",

Try plotting on the Bloch sphere the circuit from the previous exercise (`Exercise 2`)."

Considering this approach, when dealing with entangled states, there is no single-qubit measurement basis for which a specific measurement is guaranteed, that would miss the important effect of correlation between the qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot distinguish between different entangled states. For example, the two states: $\\ket{\\Phi^{+}}$ and $\\ket{\\Psi^{+}}$ will look the same on two separate Bloch spheres, despite being very different states with different measurement outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "How else could we visualize this statevector? This statevector is simply a collection of four amplitudes (complex numbers), and there are endless ways we can map this to an image. One such visualization is the [Q-sphere](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/api/qiskit/qiskit.visualization.plot_state_qsphere). Here each amplitude is represented by a blob on the surface of a sphere. The size of the blob is proportional to the magnitude of the amplitude, and the colour is proportional to the phase of the amplitude. The amplitudes for $\\ket{00}$ and $\\ket{11}$ are equal, and all other amplitudes are 0:"

In this case, the real quantum processors are not accessible to us. We just have to submit our circuits and IBM will execute them in an actual quantum processor.\n",
